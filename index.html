      <h2>What is Carb?</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to our friend group Carb! We're a tight-knit group of
        individuals who have known each other since our high school days. Our
        bond has only grown stronger over the years, and we share a passion for
        anime, gaming, and spending quality time together.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're a group of like-minded individuals who love to hang out and chat
        on Discord. Whether we're discussing the latest anime series, playing
        our favorite games, or simply catching up on each other's lives, we
        always have a great time. We believe that the key to our strong
        friendship is our shared interests and our ability to support each other
        through thick and thin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our love for anime and gaming has brought us even closer together. We've
        spent countless hours watching anime series and playing games together,
        and we're always on the lookout for new and exciting titles to explore.
        Our passion for these hobbies has also led us to attend anime and gaming
        conventions, where we've made many more friends who share our interests.
